## What is this for?

ERC223 is a [token standard](https://www.saturn.network/blog/advantages-of-erc223-tokens/) that fixes some of the popular ERC20's shortcomings. Unfortunately this standard has failed to get bread a adoption and people, and most importantly the #defi ecosystem, are rallying around the ERC20 standard.

This wrapper allows communities to create a ERC20 token that can be used anywhere, backed by the original ERC223 token's value. For example, check out [Saturn20 token on etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xaf350211414c5dc176421ea05423f0cc494261fb) that is backed by [saturn tokens](https://www.saturn.network/blog/benefit-of-saturn-tokens/).
